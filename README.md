> PHP & MySQL project.

This project was created to test my understanding of PHP and MySQL following my study of their guide. Its objective is to develop RESTful JSON APIs that promote the offers of a hypothetical travel agency. The agency's goal is to introduce people to sustainable travel options that broaden their horizons.




## API

These APIs enable the insertion, modification, and deletion of a country, which has only one attribute - its name. They also allow the management of trips, which are defined by their destinations and available seats. Additionally, the APIs allow for the filtering of trips by country and the number of available seats.
